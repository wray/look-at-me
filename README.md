# Look At me
## Code Em Assignment - Middle Intermediate

This assignment is pretty free form. The objectives are to make sure you can put together a very simple webpage/site with custom HTML/CSS design from scratch (not Scratch the programming language, but on your own ;) ) using Git and potentially GitHub pages to publish.

For this assignment, you'll see a simple index.html page in the docs directory. And you can actually use Github pages to host the page for you so all can see your beautiful results, like [so](https://wray.github.io/look-at-me/).


## Minimum Requirements

* Create a web page with information about yourself (think resume) or a page about a special interest.
* Write your own HTML/CSS and include images as needed to create a crisp, modern designed page.
* You may already have a resume site and it is fine to copy that over, but then please consider the additional requirements.

## Additional Requirements (think extra credit)

* Adjust your repo settings to host on github.io.
* Make a site, not just a page.
* Make it device-aware (i.e. scales down for a phone -- hamburger menus and all).
* Add in JavaScript for some dynamic fun or call an API.
* Suggest a re-design of our [aging](http://techemstudios.com) site.
